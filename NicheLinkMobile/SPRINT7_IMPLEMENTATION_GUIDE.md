# 🚀 NicheLink Mobile - Sprint 7 Implementation Guide

## 📱 Overview
Sprint 7 successfully implements Phase 1 (Authentication) and foundational features for the NicheLink mobile app. The app is now ready for development with a robust authentication system, camera integration, push notifications, and mobile-optimized workflows.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Phase 1: Authentication System
- **Login/Register Screens**: Full authentication UI with validation
- **Role-based Navigation**: Separate flows for SME and Influencer users
- **Secure Token Storage**: AsyncStorage integration with auto-refresh
- **Auth Context**: Centralized state management for authentication
- **Protected Routes**: AuthGuard component for route protection

### Core Mobile Features
- **Camera Integration**: Photo/video capture with expo-camera
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time notifications with expo-notifications
- **Mobile-First UI**: Dark/light mode with NativeWind/Tailwind CSS
- **Touch-Friendly Interface**: Optimized buttons and gestures
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
All required packages are already installed:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Backend URL
Update the API base URL in `services/authService.ts`:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-api-domain.com/api/v1';
```

### 3. Configure Push Notifications
Update your Expo project ID in `services/notificationService.ts`:
```typescript
const token = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
  projectId: 'your-expo-project-id',
});
```

### 4. Start Development
```bash
npm start
```

## 📲 Testing the App

### Authentication Flow
1. Run the app on your device/simulator
2. You'll be redirected to the login screen
3. Try registering a new account (SME or Influencer)
4. Login with your credentials
5. Navigate between protected routes

### Camera Features
1. Go to the "Explore" tab
2. Test the camera integration:
   - Open Camera: Full camera interface
   - Quick Capture: Simple photo capture
   - Media Picker: Choose from library or camera

### Push Notifications
1. In the "Explore" tab, tap "Send Test Notification"
2. Grant notification permissions when prompted
3. You should receive a test notification

## 🔧 Backend Integration

### Required API Endpoints
Your backend should implement these endpoints:

```typescript
POST /api/v1/auth/login
POST /api/v1/auth/register
POST /api/v1/auth/logout
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
POST /api/v1/notifications/register
```

### Authentication Response Format
```typescript
{
  "success": boolean,
  "user": {
    "id": string,
    "email": string,
    "firstName": string,
    "lastName": string,
    "role": "SME" | "INFLUENCER",
    "verified": boolean
  },
  "tokens": {
    "accessToken": string,
    "refreshToken": string,
    "expiresIn": number
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Next Development Phases

## 🛠️ Development Tips

### Debugging
- Use React DevTools for component debugging
- Check Expo DevTools for build issues
- Use `console.log` in services for API debugging

### Testing on Device
1. Install Expo Go app on your mobile device
2. Scan the QR code from `npm start`
3. Test camera and notification features (simulators have limitations)

### Code Organization
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Follow the established folder structure
- Use the themed components for consistent UI

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Tokens are stored securely in AsyncStorage
- Automatic token refresh prevents session expiry
- Password validation enforces security standards

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data in component state
- API calls use proper error handling
- User inputs are validated and sanitized

## 📱 Platform-Specific Notes

### iOS
- Camera permissions handled automatically
- Native notification sounds available
- SF Pro font recommended

### Android
- Custom notification channels configured
- Edge-to-edge display support
- Roboto font system default

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera not working**: Check device permissions in Settings
2. **Notifications not showing**: Ensure physical device testing
3. **Auth errors**: Verify backend API endpoints
4. **Build errors**: Clear cache with `expo r -c`

### Performance Tips
- Use `expo-image` for optimized image loading
- Implement lazy loading for large lists
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Monitor bundle size with Expo tools
